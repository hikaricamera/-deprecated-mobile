Issue:
Couldn't find preset "module:metro-react-native-babel-preset" relative to directory "/home/stanley/Documents/sides/hikari_cam_mobile"

Solution:
In .babelrc, change to
        { "presets": ["react-native"] }
Note that after testing, change it back to
        { "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"] }
